I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington. I majored in Mathematics and minored in Data Science. I am planning on pursuing graduate education in Statistics/Applied Mathematics.

My interests in applied math are in signal processing, specifically in the area of acoustics. My hobbies include running, swimming, and (very inconsistently) playing the piano.

At Echospace, I am working on the Hake Machine Learning (ML) Project.

The Hake ML Project is a Data Processing and Convolutional Neural Network project focused on the development of machine learning models for automatically detecting Pacific hake in large volumes of echosounder data.

One of the software packages I am developing and maintaining in this project is [EchoRegions](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoregions): A Python data processing software package to create region and bottom masks for echosounder data using both Echoview data and data products from [Echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype).

For any inquiries, feel free to contact me via email!
